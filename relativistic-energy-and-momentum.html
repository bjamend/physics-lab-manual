            In 1905, Albert Einstein replaced the Newtonian forms of energy and momentum in his special theory of relativity<sup><a href="#einstein-1905" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[1]</a></sup>, but it was Max Planck who first showed that energy and momentum together comprise a relativistic invariant<sup><a href="#planck-1906" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[2]</a></sup>.
            The relevance of this invariant to quantum mechanics was emphasized by Paul Dirac in 1928<sup><a href="#dirac-1928" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[3]</a></sup>, and has been a foundational principle in particle physics ever since.
            The lingering question of why different particles carry different invariant masses was answered by the Higgs mechanism—first proposed in a non-relativistic framework in 1963 by Philip Anderson<sup><a href="#anderson-1963" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[4]</a></sup>, then independently in 1964 by multiple people<sup><a href="#englert-1964" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#higgs-1964" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#guralnik-1964" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[7]</a></sup>—which gives masses to the W and Z bosons and to fermions via a pervading scalar field.
            This idea was confirmed in 2012, when the ATLAS and CMS experiments at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reported a new $\sim 125\,\mathrm{GeV}$ scalar with the properties expected of the Higgs boson<sup><a href="#aad-2012" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[8]</a></sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this lab, you will re-discover the Higgs boson by analyzing data from CERN's LHC.

            The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is the theoretical framework describing the
            fundamental particles and their interactions, excluding gravity.
            It successfully explains a vast range of physical phenomena and has been tested extensively in experiments such as those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
            The SM is built on quantum field theory, incorporating principles from quantum mechanics and special relativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SM categorizes particles into fermions and bosons, as indicated in the figure below.

            <strong>Fermions</strong>, which obey the Pauli exclusion principle and have half-integer spin, are further divided into quarks and leptons.
            Quarks experience all four fundamental forces and come in six flavors: up ("u"), down ("d"), charm ("c"), strange ("s"), top ("t"), and bottom ("b").
            They combine to form hadrons, such as protons and neutrons.
            Leptons do not experience the strong nuclear force.
            The six types include the electron ($e^-$), muon ($\mu^-$), tau ($\tau^-$), and their corresponding neutrinos ($\nu_e, \nu_{\mu}, \nu_{\tau}$).
            Quarks and leptons are organized into three generations, with increasing mass and decreasing stability from the first to the third.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bosons</strong> mediate the fundamental forces of nature and have integer spin.
            The photon ($\gamma$) is the force carrier of electromagnetism.
            The W and Z bosons (W$\pm$, Z$^0$) mediate the weak nuclear force, responsible for processes like beta decay.
            The gluon (g) is the mediator of the strong nuclear force, binding quarks together in protons and neutrons.
            The Higgs boson (H) is responsible for giving mass to fundamental particles via the Higgs mechanism.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SM incorporates three of the four fundamental interactions.
            The electromagnetic force, governed by quantum electrodynamics (QED), acts on electrically charged particles and is mediated by the photon.
            The weak nuclear force is responsible for processes such as beta decay; it affects all fermions and is mediated by the W and Z bosons.
            The strong nuclear force, described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), binds quarks inside protons and neutrons via gluon exchange.
            The gravitational force is not included in the SM, as it currently lacks a quantum description.
          </p>

            Several conservation laws play fundamental roles in particle physics.
            <strong>Charge conservation</strong> ensures that electric charge remains unchanged in interactions.
            <strong>Energy and momentum conservation</strong> apply universally across all interactions.
            <strong>Baryon number conservation</strong> dictates that the total number of baryons (such as protons and neutrons) remains constant in known interactions.
            <strong>Lepton number conservation</strong> ensures that each lepton family (electron, muon, tau) maintains a separate lepton number in interactions.
            <strong>Color charge conservation</strong> applies in QCD, ensuring that quarks always interact in a way that maintains overall color neutrality.
            While several of these conservation laws will play a role in our lab, the most important here is the conservation of energy and momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Energy and momentum are linked in special relativity, unified through the energy-momentum invariant,
          </p>
          <div id="eq-energy-momentum-invariant">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                E^2 = p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4 \,.\label{eq:energy-momentum-invariant}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Here, $E$ is the particle's energy, $p$ its momentum, $m_0$ its <strong>rest mass</strong>, and $c$ the speed of light.
            This relationship is called an invariant because it is valid in any inertial reference frame.
          </p>
          <p>
            In high-energy particle physics, there are types of particles that are too short-lived to detect directly.
            Fortunately, these particles decay into other particles that can be detected, and we can work backwards to determine the invariant masses of the parent particles, obtained by solving the energy-momentum invariant for the rest-mass energy term,
          </p>
          <div id="eq-rest-mass-energy">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                m_0c^2 = \sqrt{E^2 - p^2c^2} \,.\label{eq:rest-mass-energy}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Then, for particles that have multiple decay products,
          </p>
          <div id="eq-multiple-particles">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                \boxed{m_0c^2 = \sqrt{E_{\mathrm{tot}}^2 - c^2 \vec{p}_{\mathrm{tot}} \cdot \vec{p}_{\mathrm{tot}}}} \,,\label{eq:multiple-particles}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            where the subscript indicates total energy or total momentum, summed across all decay products.
            Thus, measuring the energies and momenta of all decay products of some initial parent particle, the invariant mass of this parent particle can be calculated without having to detect it directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that particle momenta are not typically measured in $x$, $y$, and $z$ components.
            Rather, they are measured in terms of their direction relative to the particle beam that produced them, and these directions are termed $t$ for transverse, $\phi$ for azimuthal, and $\eta$ for pseudorapidity.
            Momenta can be converted from these components to Cartesian coordinates via
          </p>
          <div id="eq-conversions">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                p_x = p_t\cos{\phi}\,, \hspace{0.5cm} p_y = p_t\sin{\phi}\,, \hspace{0.5cm} p_z = p_t \sinh{\eta} \,.\label{eq:conversions}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The goal of this lab is to detect the Higgs boson, a particle that mediates the Higgs mechanism, responsible for endowing mass to massive particles.
            The Higgs boson (H) decays through a variety of different channels, but one of its most common is
          </p>
          <div id="eq-higgs-decay">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow \ell\ell\ell\ell \,.\label{eq:higgs-decay}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            In this process, the Higgs boson first decays into two Z bosons, one of which (Z*) is off-shell (meaning its mass differs from the typical value for a Z boson).
            Each of these Z bosons then further decay into two oppositely-charged leptons of the same flavor (e.g. both must be electrons or muons; taus are not included here).
            It's these groupings of leptons that we can use to infer the existence of the Higgs boson; however, there are also other particles and other decay channels that produce these lepton combinations.
            As such, we will ultimately end up with a distribution of invariant masses.
            The key then will be to explain the existance of as many of these masses as possible with <em>known</em> particles, and any left unexplained can be attributed to novel particles (e.g. the Higgs boson).

                The energy and momentum components of the electron are $(E, p_t, \phi, \eta) = (136.56\,\mathrm{GeV}, 51.14\,\mathrm{GeV/c}, 1.05, -1.66)$, and the energy and momentum components of the positron are $(E, p_t, \phi, \eta) = (67.61\,\mathrm{GeV}, 44.15\,\mathrm{GeV/c}, -2.20, -1.01)$.
