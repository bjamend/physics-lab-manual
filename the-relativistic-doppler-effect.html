          <p>
            As discussed in the classical Doppler effect lab, Christian Doppler first proposed in 1842 that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative motion of source and observer, laying the groundwork for what became known as the Doppler effect<sup><a href="#eden-1992" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[1]</a></sup>.
            His idea as written initially applied to stars, and it was tested shortly thereafter by astronomers such as Armand Fizeau<sup><a href="#houdas-1991" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[2]</a></sup> and William Huggins<sup><a href="#huggins-1868" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[3]</a></sup>, who attempted to detect wavelength shifts in stellar spectra.
            With the advent of the Lorentz transformation in the 1890s and Einstein’s formulation of special relativity in 1905, the classical Doppler formula was revised to include time dilation, yielding the relativistic Doppler shift that predicts asymmetric changes in frequencies between approaching and receding sources.
            Experimental confirmation of the relativistic effect came in the late 1930s with the Ives–Stilwell experiment, which measured the Doppler shift of positive ion beams in charged gases, and directly verified time dilation’s role in these spectral shifts<sup><a href="#ives-1938" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[4]</a></sup>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this lab, you will use the relativistic Doppler shift to measure Hubble's constant—a parameter that characterizes the expansion rate of the universe.

            As was the case with the theory behind the classical Doppler shift, there's not much more to the relativistic shift outside of a derivation, as you'll be exploring its behavior yourself.
            Consider a plane electromagnetic wave propagating in the positive $x$‐direction in an inertial frame $S$ with angular frequency $\omega$ and wavenumber $k=\omega/c$.
            In a second frame $S'$ moving at velocity $v=\beta c$ along the positive $x$ direction relative to $S$, the spacetime coordinates are related by the Lorentz transformation

              $$\begin{equation}
                t' = \gamma\left(t - \frac{vx}{c^2}\right), \hspace{0.5cm} x' = \gamma(x - vt)\,, \label{eq:lorentz-transformation}

          <p>
            is an invariant scalar, so $\phi = \omega t - kx = \omega't' - k'x'$. Substituting the Lorentz transforms and collecting terms in $t$ and $x$ gives
          </p>
          <div id="eq-substitution">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}

          </div>
          <p>
            Equating coefficients of $t$ and $x$ yields two simultaneous relations, but using $k'=\omega'/c$ in the $x$ coefficient equation reduces to the same condition as the $t$ coefficient, namely

          <div id="eq-condition">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}

              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Solving this for $\omega'$ then yields

            Since $\omega = 2\pi\nu$ and $\gamma=(1-\beta^2)^{-1/2}$,

            In this formula, positive $\beta$ corresponds to the source moving <em>away</em> from the observer.

            In the context of astronomy, observers frequently refer to a quantity $z$ known as 'redshift'.
            This is defined as

NGC stands for 'New General Catalog', consisting primarily of galaxies and star clusters. Some of these objects have spectra, some do not, so you are to repeat this step until you find an object that does (you will know because the 'Spectra' tab under the search results will have entries listed).

            <li>
              <strong>Identify H$\alpha$ Line:</strong> By looking at the different spectra graphs, find a spectrum (some measure of flux vs. wavelength) with a sharp line that peaks somewhere in the vicinity of $660\,\mathrm{nm}$.
              This is the H-$\alpha$ line, which has a known rest-frame wavelength of $656.28\,\mathrm{nm}$.

            <li>
              <strong>Measure Doppler Shift:</strong> Measure the wavelength shift between the rest-frame wavelength and the observed wavelength from the spectrum data, and use this to calculate the redshift of the galaxy/star cluster.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Calculate Velocity:</strong> From the wavelength shift, calculate the corresponding velocity.

            <li>
              <strong>Fit Trendline:</strong> Finally, fit a trendline to the velocity vs. distance data to estimate Hubble's constant $H_0$ via $v=H_0D$.
