            The classical Doppler effect was first described in 1842 by Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, who proposed that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative motion between the source and the observer<sup><a href="#eden-1992" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[1]</a></sup>.
            Originally intended to explain color differences in binary stars, his idea was soon tested more directly with sound waves.
            In 1845, Dutch scientist Christophorus Henricus Diedericus Buys Ballot confirmed the effect by using a moving train and trumpet players to demonstrate the change in pitch as the source moved toward and away from a stationary observer<sup><a href="#ballot-1845" class="text-blue-300 hover:underline">[2]</a></sup>.
            Over time, the Doppler effect was applied to other types of waves, including water and light, though the classical formulation assumes a medium and does not account for all behaviors of light.
            A more complete treatment of the Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves would later emerge from developments in modern physics, which will be explored in a subsequent lab.

            In this lab, you will estimate the speed of sound by measuring the Doppler shift in frequency produced by moving sound sources.

            Consider a source emitting sound wave crests at a steady rate $f_s$ into a medium where waves travel at sound speed $v$.
            By definition, the source's emission period is $T_s = 1/f_s$.
            If this source were at rest, the spacing between the wave crests would be
          </p>
          <div id="eq-wave-spacing">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                \Delta \lambda = vT_s\,. \label{eq:wave-spacing}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Now suppose the source moves at speed $v_s$ relative to the stationary medium.
            The quantity $v_s$ can be positive or negative depending on the direction of motion.
            In the time $T_s$ between two successive 'emissions', it advances a distance $v_sT_s$, so the spacing of crests observed by a stationary observer becomes
          </p>
          <div id="eq-wave-spacing-2">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                \Delta \lambda' = \Delta\lambda - v_sT_s = (v-v_s)T_s = \frac{v-v_s}{f_s}\,. \label{eq:wave-spacing-2}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Note that if $v_s$ is <em>positive</em>, the spacing between wave crests <em>decreases</em>, and if $v_s$ is <em>negative</em>, this spacing <em>increases</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now consider an observer who moves through the medium at speed $v_o$.
            As was the case with the source speed $v_s$, $v_o$ can be positive (indicating motion <em>towards</em> the source) or negative (indicating motion <em>away</em> from the source).
            From the observer's point of view, the speed of the crests is simply the sum of the wave speed in the medium $v$ with the observer's speed $v_o$.
            The observed frequency $f_o$ is the rate at which the crests pass by,
          </p>
          <div id="eq-observed-frequency">
            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                f_o = \frac{v + v_o}{\Delta \lambda'}\,. \label{eq:observed-frequency}
              \end{equation}$$
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Substituting in <a href="#eq-wave-spacing-2" class="text-blue-300 font-bold hover:underline"> Equation $\ref{eq:wave-spacing-2}$</a>, we obtain the general formulation for the Doppler shift—the shift in frequency associated with motion of the source and/or the observer relative to some stationary medium:

            <p>
              $$\begin{equation}
                \boxed{f_o = f_s \frac{v+v_o}{v-v_s}}\,. \label{eq:doppler-shift}

            <li><p>Compare your answers from questions 1 and 2.
            Are they the same, or different?
            If they are different, explain why.</p></li>
            <li><p>Consider a small speaker attached to a string spinning in a circle of radius $R$ at a rotational frequency $\omega$.
            The speaker emits a tone at frequency $f_s$.
            The plane of rotation is horizontally oriented (think of spinning pizza dough).
            You are standing a distance $d \gg R$ away from the center of rotation, with your ears at the same height as the speaker.
            Taking the sound speed in air to be $v$, write an expression for the frequency you will hear, to within a phase constant.
            Your answer should be a function of $t$, and in terms of $R$, $\omega$, $f_s$, and $v$.
            <strong>Hint:</strong> $d$ should not be included in this expression given the limit that $d \gg R$.</p></li>

          Your goal in this lab is to obtain as accurate a measure of the speed of sound as possible.
          An audio analysis tool of some sort will be required in order to accomplish this, and Audacity is recommended since it is free and easy to use. There are two particular features you may find useful upon loading in (or recording) an audio track:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal">
            <li>
              <strong>The Spectrogram View</strong> - This is an alternate view of the sound signal on any given track, showing a color map of the intensities of different frequencies.
              This view can be useful as you can, in some cases, pick out by eye where certain frequency shifts are occurring.
              This view can be enabled by clicking on the three little dots next to the track name and selecting 'Spectrogram'.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Plot Spectrum Tool</strong> - This generates a histogram of all frequencies over the selected window of time.
              This can be useful for averaging out noisy frequencies, as well as providing a more quantitative measure of what is shown in the spectrogram view.
              This is an analysis tool that can be applied to the entire track or a section of a track; once a selection has been made, it can be found under Analyze -> Plot Spectrum.
              Note that you can also export this histogram data to do further analysis in Python if needed.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p></p>
          <p>To generate the audio that you will be analyzed, you are encourage to try a few different techniques, including moving sources, moving observers, rotating objects (e.g. pre-lab questions 4 and 5), etc.</p>
