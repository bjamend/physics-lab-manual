        In 1827, Scottish botanist Robert Brown was analyzing pollen grains suspended in water under a microscope when he noticed that the grains were shedding even smaller particles that underwent random, erratic motion. Since he was studying the fertilization process of a newly-discovered flowering plant, he initially assumed that this behavior was biological in nature, akin to that seen in some motile gametes like sperm. However, after recreating the effect using pollen from long-dead plants, and even entirely inorganic particles, Brown concluded that something else must be causing the phenomenon. The jittery movements of these ‘Active Molecules’ as Brown termed them would later be referred to as ‘Brownian Motion’ in his honor, and the search for an associated causal mechanism ultimately shifted to the realm of physics many decades later.

        While mathematicians Thorvald Thiele and Louis Bachelier independently characterized this motion by providing mathematical descriptions in 1880 and 1900, respectively, the physical processes behind it remained unknown until Albert Einstein published his 1905 paper, “On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat”. In this journal article, Einstein explained the mechanisms behind Brownian motion using newly developed principles of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, proving the existence of atoms in the process. He demonstrated that particles like Brown’s pollen grains were continually colliding with the molecules comprising the fluid in the surrounding suspension, giving rise to the observed motion. While other physicists’ reception to these ideas was at first tentative, further tests conducted by French physicist Jean-Baptiste Perrin a few years later provided convincing experimental verification. For these results, Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1926, and Einstein’s 1905 analysis of Brownian motion has been held in high esteem ever since, alongside his seminal work on special relativity and the photoelectric effect that same year.

        Before exploring the physics behind Brownian motion, it is instructive to learn first about the mathematics that govern it. In most motion problems, the ultimate goal is to obtain an equation that describes an object’s trajectory in space as a function of time. You explored this in your introductory physics courses when you solved constant-acceleration kinematics problems. All objects in these problems obeyed the following familiar equation:
      </p>
      <p>
        $$\begin{equation}
          \vec{x} = \vec{x}_0 + \vec{v}t + \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2
        \end{equation}$$
      </p>
      <p>
        We would like to develop a similar equation for a particle undergoing Brownian motion, but there’s a catch. The motions of an apple falling from a tree, a projectile being launched from a cannon, a car accelerating from rest at a constant rate - all of these processes are deterministic in nature. If you were to repeat them all with the same initial conditions, each of these objects would trace out the exact same trajectory every single time. Brownian motion, however, is entirely random, lacking the determinism that makes pinpointing precise spatial trajectories possible for macroscopic objects. At any given instant in time, a particle undergoing Brownian motion is equally likely to move in any direction, making it impossible to describe its path with an equation like (1). This path, formed by successive steps in random directions, is known as a random walk, and it is almost always different with each repetition.
